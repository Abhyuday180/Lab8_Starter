> How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 
Using service workers helps your website keep working, even if something goes wrong;like losing internet connection. Service workers can save (cache) parts of the website ahead of time. So if the network isn’t available later, the site can still load from the saved data. This way, the website doesn’t break completely and users can still use it, even with limited access.
